## Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the idea that a class or object is denied the ability to directly manipulate the data or data processes belonging to another class or object. Each class or object is responsible for how their data is manipulated or how their data processes run.
## Abstraction
A class is said to be properly abstracted when it's functions and data provided can be understood and used, without having to understand every aspect of the internal workings of the function on a low level. So, a person can make use of the class without having to thing about the internal details of the class, but being able to understand the class from a much higher level. An example is how programmers and others who used computers are able to get it to do what they need without having to understand low level computer programming (how exactly the computer takes in and processes commands it receives)
## Inheritance
A child class is one that inherits functionality from another class (called its prent class). The ability to do this is inheritance. It's like how all dog classes would share/inherit functionality from a mammal class, which in turn would inherit from an animal class.
