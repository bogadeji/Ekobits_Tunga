# Part 1
1. The `$PATH` variable is an environment variable that the terminal uses to find programs to execute.
2. We create environment variables to pass configuration information to applications.
3. Environment variables are saved by modifying the shell configuration file in the home directory.
4. A process is a program or application being run on a computer.
5. To list all processes running on my machine, I use the `ps aux` command.
6. `PID` is a process id. It is used to uniquely identify a process.
7. A process can be terminated using either the `kill` or `kill -9` commands.
8. The `kill` command is used to terminate a process. It can, however be ignored by a process if perhaps the application is frozen and unable to accept or process any commands sent to it. the `kill -9` command on the other hand is used to explicitly kill a process and cannot be ignored.
9. The `-i` flag allows for case insensitive search using the `grep` command.
10. The `-B` flag allows for a certain number of lines before the match using the grep command.
11. The `-C` flag allows for a certain number of lines around the match using the `grep` command.
12. The `-A` flag allows for a certain number of lines after the match using the `grep` command.
13. The `w` flag allows for full word search using the grep command.
14. The `n` flag shows the line number of a match using the grep command.
