# Navigating in Terminal

1. `/` directs to the root directory, while `~`directs to home directory
2. `cd` is used to change directory
3. The absolute path to reach a file is the way to reach the file starting from the root directory. The relative path to any file is the path to reach the file relative to the present directory location.
